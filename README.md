## About The Project

Golang parser combinator library (inspired by haskell parsec).

> But what is parser combinator?

> In the parse combinatorial framework, a "parser" is a function that takes some semistructured input and produces some structured output, and "combinator" is a function that allows combining / composing things. So "parser combinators" is a way of expressing a system where you write a lot of small parsing functions and compose then together.
